function GetQuiz(connectionString):
    Create an empty list called quizList

    Create a new NpgsqlConnection object with the provided connectionString

    Open the connection

    Create a new NpgsqlCommand object with the SQL query and the connection

    Execute the command and obtain a NpgsqlDataReader object

    while there are rows to read in the reader:
        Read the values from the reader for id, questionText, optionName, and optionText

        Create a new object with the properties ID, QuestionText, OptionName, and OptionText using the read values

        Add the created object to the quizList

    Close the reader, the command, and the connection

    Serialize the quizList to a JSON string using the JsonConvert class

    Return the JSON string

end function


Dictionary<int, Dictionary<string, string>> quizDict = new Dictionary<int, Dictionary<string, string>>();

That line of code is declaring and initializing a variable called quizDict. Let's break it down:

Dictionary<int, Dictionary<string, string>> is the type declaration of the variable. It specifies that quizDict is a dictionary with keys of type int and values of type Dictionary<string, string>.
quizDict is the name of the variable.
new Dictionary<int, Dictionary<string, string>>() is the initialization part. It creates a new instance of the Dictionary<int, Dictionary<string, string>> class and assigns it to the quizDict variable.
To understand this line in more detail, let's look at the structure of the quizDict dictionary:

The keys of quizDict are of type int and represent the question IDs.
The values of quizDict are of type Dictionary<string, string>, which is another dictionary. This inner dictionary represents the options for each question.
The keys of the inner dictionary are of type string and represent the option names (e.g., "A", "B", "C", "D").
The values of the inner dictionary are also of type string and represent the option texts (e.g., "Vancouver", "Ottawa", "Toronto", "Montreal").
So, quizDict is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve quiz data based on the question ID and the corresponding options. It serves as a temporary storage while retrieving data from the database before transforming it into the desired format.
